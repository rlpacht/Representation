#Representation
==============
##Overview
A visual representation of campaign finance data for United States politicians. The goal is to make this data as easily accessabile as possible. The deployed version of the app can be found [here](https://secret-everglades-6643.herokuapp.com/)

##Features
Users can search for a politician and year. It then displays data gathered from the Sunlight Foundation API in graphs that make it easier to understand the data.

##Technologies Used
Angular
javascript
Ruby on Rails
Sunlight Foundation API
Charts.js
Spin.js

##Future Todos
I would like to integrate more APIs that would cover different data, such as voting records and bills the politicians have sponsored.
